# Company Job Distribution Dashboard

## Project Overview

The **Company Job Distribution Dashboard** is a data-driven web application built with **Flask** and **Echarts**. It provides a detailed view of job distribution across various cities and job families for selected companies. The application allows users to interact with dynamic bar charts to analyze job posting trends and understand where positions are most frequently available and which job families are in high demand.

## How to Run the Application

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-folder>
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Flask application**.

    ```bash
    python -m flask run
    ```

    This will start the Flask development server at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
